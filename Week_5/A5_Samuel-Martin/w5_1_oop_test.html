  <p>There are a couple of problems with our bio() method from the last example
    â€” the output always includes the pronoun "He", even if your person is female,
    or some other preferred gender classification.</p>
  <p>And the bio only includes two interests, even if more are listed in the interests array. </p>
  <p>Can you work out how to fix this in the class definition (constructor)?
    You can put any code you like inside a constructor (you'll probably need a few conditionals and a loop in the bio method).
    Think about how the sentences should be structured differently depending on gender,
    and depending on whether the number of listed interests is 1, 2, or more than 2.</p>
  <p>Once that is done, have the three buttons display the bio of each person in the section</p>

  <button id="b1" class="bioButton">Bob</button>
  <button id="b2" class="bioButton">Cathy</button>
  <button id="b3" class="bioButton">Pat</button>

  <section id="displayBio"></section>
