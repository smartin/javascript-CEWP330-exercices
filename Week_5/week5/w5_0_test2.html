  <h3>Create your own object literal to represent one of your favorite bands.
    The required members are:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>name: A string representing the band name.</li>
    <li>nationality: A string representing the country the band comes from.</li>
    <li>genre: What type of music the band plays.</li>
    <li>members: A number representing the number of members the band has.</li>
    <li>formed: A number representing the year the band formed.</li>
    <li>split: A number representing the year the band split up, or false if they are still together.</li>
    <li>albums: An array representing the albums released by the band.
      Each array item should be an object containing the following members:
      <ul>
        <li>name: A string representing the name of the album.</li>
        <li>released: A number representing the year the album was released.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Include at least two albums in the albums array.</p>
  <p>Once you've done this, you should then write a string to the variable bandInfo,
  which will contain a small biography detailing their name,
  nationality, years active, and style,
  and the title and release date of their first album.</p>
