<body>
  <p>Finally in our object basics assessment, we want you to return to the cat object literal from Task #1. </p>
  <p>We want you to rewrite the greeting() method so that it logs "Hello, said Bertie the Cymric." to the browser DevTools' console, but in a way that will work across any cat object of the same structure, regardless of its name or breed.</p>
  <p>When you are done, write your own object called cat2, which has the same structure, exactly the same greeting() method, but a different name, breed, and color.</p>
  <p>Call both greeting() methods to check that they log appropriate greetings to the console.</p>
  <p>"How would you make the code more DRY?": By creating a cat class in which to define the properties and method so they are only defined once, and then creating instances of that class.</p>
  <p>we get to that in the next lesson</p>
